## **FAQs:**
1. **Why is Markdown better than Word processor?**
    * Markdowns easy to learn simplified syntax, provides a much easier and more streamlined process than Mcrosoft Word, and only takes an average of an hour to learn.  
    * Markdown removes the clunkiness of the task bar, numerous mouse clicks and helps keep fingers on keyboards, making the documentation process quicker and more efficient.
2. **Why is my Them not showing up?**
    * GitHub does not automatically update with the most current changes. Updates can take up to 20 minutes to be applied after they have been comitted. If GitHub is overloaded the update may take up to and longer than an hour.
