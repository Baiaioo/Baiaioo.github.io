## <ins>**Education**</ins>
**University of Manitoba**: Bachelor of Science, Computer Science  
Garduation: June 2023  
  
 **COMP 2031**: Discrete Mathemetaics in Computer Science  
  *  In this course I was introduced to core math that supports our field, including set-theory and graph-theory, and the mathematical proof we rely on. 
 
**COMP 2040**: Data Structures and Algorithms  
* In Java, I implemented multiple data-structures from scratch (including linked-lists, queues, stacks, and hash tables) and implemented multiple algorithms (including binary-tree traversals, quicksort, and merge sort).  
  
**COMP 2160**: Programming Practices
* As our final project, I implemented a memory pool with mark-and-sweep garbage collection and defragmentation in C. This course was my first introduction to defensive programming and black box testing.  
  
**COMP 3020**: Human Computer Interaction  
* As our term project, I was part of a team of five students tasked to produce a web page to innovate on a more basic idea we researched. We had multiple milestones through the project. As we reached the later milestones team bonding and group work became much stronger. As time pressure grew, we began to make avoidable mistakes. Seeing this, We decided to each take a task and concentrate on making it work bug free. I was responsible for the website layout design and 2 of the 6 major functions.  
  
**COMP 3040**: Technical Communications in Computer Science  
* We learned about the writing process and applied to common communications and software documentation. Documentation tools used were Markdown and static sit generator Jekyll. Apart from that we learned about ethics in technical communications and how to structure and format professional messages and documents.  
  
**COMP 3380**: Databases concepts and usage  
* In this course I was introduced to ER models, relational models, relational algebra and SQL. I learned the fundamentals of how a database is created, manipulated and maintained at a high level.
